Instruction Guide: Creating a Local Pull Request and Merging It to a Remote Repository

Note: This guide maximizes the use of GitBash to implement the desired output.

1. Cloning the Repository
In your GitHub project, locate the clone URL in the branch you want to contribute to. You can find it by clicking the code button.
In this guide, we will use the desktop as our destination for cloning. In your GitBash terminal, type:
   cd desktop  // to set our destination folder
   git clone 'clone-url'  // this will clone the selected branch from GitHub to your desktop

2. Switching to the New Branch
After cloning, switch from the main branch to your destination branch:
   cd 'local repository directory'  // this will allow us to enter the cloned repo
   git branch  // this will display the available branches in your repository
   git branch 'new_branch'  // this will create a new branch of your desired name
   git branch  // just to make sure and check if the new branch is created (optional)
   git switch 'new_branch'  // this will select the new branch
   git branch  // just to make sure if the branch is successfully switched; it will be highlighted

3. Adding Files
Make sure to add your files in the local folder created after cloning. If the files are already in the folder, proceed to step 4.

4. Updating Your Local Branch
Update your current local branch with the latest changes from the `new_branch` in the remote repository:
   git pull origin new_branch  // used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository branch into your current local branch
   git status  // used to display the state of the working directory; this will display the files available in the cloned folder
   git add .  // used to stage all the changes in the current directory and its subdirectories, preparing them for the next commit
   git status  // just to make sure and see if the files were added

5. Committing Your Changes
Commit your changes:
   git commit -m 'commit_description'  // used to create a commit with a message that describes the changes being committed
   git push -u origin 'new_branch'  // used to push a local branch to the remote repository and set it up to track the remote branch

6. Checking the Repository
After completion, check your repository on the GitHub site. It should be successfully updated with the files you added.
