# How to run solutions.py
### 1. Open Git Bash: Launch Git Bash on your computer.

### 2. Navigate to the script's directory: Use the cd command to change to the directory where your solutions.py file is located. For example in my testing is: 
```bash
    cd desktop/env/python_testing/mike
```
### 3. Run the script: Once you're in the correct directory, you can run the script by typing: python solution.py

#### Note: Make sure you have Python installed and properly configured in your system's PATH environment variable.
